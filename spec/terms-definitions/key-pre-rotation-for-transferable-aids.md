[[def: Key Pre-Rotation for Transferable AIDs, key-pre-rotation-for-transferable-aids]]

~ KERI, the authoritative key stage of a transferable AID consists of two sets of key-pairs. The first set is the current set of signing keys and the second set is the pre-committed set of one-time rotation keys that after rotation will become the next or pre-rotated set of signing keys. These two sets provide the basis for KERIâ€™s pre-rotation mechanism and the on-device storage of public/private key pairs associated with an AID.
