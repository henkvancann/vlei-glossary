[[def: Key Management, key-management]]

~ Unless otherwise specified, the term _key-pair_ refers to an asymmetric (public, private) key-pair for digital signatures. The private key is used to generate signatures and the public key is used to validate signatures. 

~ Ecosystem key management policies are grouped into three sets of policies for protecting three different infrastructures:

~ 1. Key-pair creation and storage infrastructure;
~ 2. Signature creation infrastructure;
~ 3. Signature verification infrastructure.
