[[def: Witness, witness]]
~ An entity or component designated (trusted) by the Controller of an identifier. The primary role of a Witness is to verify, sign, and keep events associated with an identifier. A Witness is the Controller of its own self-referential identifier which may or may not be the same as the identifier to which it is a Witness. As a special case a Controller may serve as its own Witness. Witness designations are included in key (establishment) events. As a result, the role of a Witness may be verified using the identifierâ€™s rotation history. When designated, a Witness becomes part of the supporting infrastructure establishing and maintaining control authority over an identifier. An identifier Witness therefore is part of its trust basis and may be controlled (but not necessarily so) by its Controller.
